# ADS Bootcamp 2022
Was introduced to the following structures and algorithms, used some of them in a practical application to solve a certain task!

Data Structures:

1) Arrays
2) Linked Lists
3) Stacks
4) Queues
5) Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
6) Graphs
7) Hash Tables
8) Heaps

Algorithms:

1) Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
2) Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
3) Graph Traversal Algorithms (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search) [was at Discrete Math course]
4) Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm) [was at Discrete Math course]
5) Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms (Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm) 
6) Divide and Conquer Algorithms
7) Backtracking Algorithms
8) Greedy Algorithms [was at Programming basic course]
