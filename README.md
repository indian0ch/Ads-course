# ADS Bootcamp 2022
Was introduced to the following structures and algorithms, used some of them in a practical application to solve a certain task!

Data Structures:

Arrays
Linked Lists
Stacks
Queues
Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
Graphs
Hash Tables
Heaps
Priority Queues
Hashing

Algorithms:

Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
Graph Traversal Algorithms (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search) [was at Discrete Math course]
Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm) [was at Discrete Math course]
Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms (Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm) 
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Backtracking Algorithms
Greedy Algorithms [was at Programming basic course]
